# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

In this  project we want to gather Mars information from NASA’s web page, and display it in a central location.
To do this, we created a web application that will scrape data every time we run it with a click of a button. Using python, we will create a database to store the gathered information and store ir using MongoDB. Once the information has been stored, we will use Flask to create the web application using python and then it will be customized with HTML and CSS.

On our web application we have included all four of the Mars hemisphere images, using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, we used a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
